# WriteMe: A Decentralized Content Creation Platform on Aleph Zero

## What it Does
WriteMe, is a platform that harnesses the potential of Aleph Zero to redefine the landscape of online content and user profiles in the Web3 era. It's not just a concept, it's a dynamic platform that encompasses the following key components:

- **Customized Writer's Profiles**: Reflect the identity of each individual and are seamlessly integrated with AZERO.ID.
- **Empowering Content Creation**: Facilitate direct donations to writers, promoting a more sustainable and supportive content ecosystem.
- **Metadata in Smart Contracts**: Store post metadata in smart contracts on Aleph Zero's testnet, enhancing transparency and security.

## How We Built It
Our journey involved the creation of smart contracts using Ink and the drink CLI. The frontend was developed using NEXT.js, with the Inkathon template and the integration of UseInkathon hooks for React.

## Challenges We Overcame
Working within the Aleph ecosystem presented unique challenges. We had to navigate with limited examples and tackle the intricacies of Rust, expanding our knowledge and pushing our boundaries in the realm of blockchain development.

## What's Next for WriteMe
Our vision for WriteMe includes the following key steps:

- **Token-Gated Decentralization**: Transform the platform into a token-gated, fully decentralized ecosystem without the need for a backend.
- **Open-Source UI Integration**: Allow for access to the protocol from multiple open-source UIs, fostering collaboration and innovation.
- **Mainnet Deployment**: Take WriteMe to the mainnet, making it accessible to a broader audience.
